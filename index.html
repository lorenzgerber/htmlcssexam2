        <h2>What is React?</h2>
        <p> React is a JavaScript library that was origninally created by
          engineers at Facebook. As a pure front-end library, it can be used
          with virtually any backend or framework.

          I got into learning React during a University project where it was
          decided that the front-end of client-server application should be built
          in React.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started with React</h2>
        <p>To start using React there are a couple of entry points. The first
          thing to do would be to install node, as react is conveniently distributed
          by the node package manager 'npm'.
          Then there are many different ways to get started. A quick and simple one
          is to use the 'create-react-app' module also available at 'npm'. It builds
          automatically the basic scaffold of a React app and sets up the wiring
          to all the helper tools for running the new app on localhost in
          browser.
          This is certainly the most simple way to get started, however,
          especially for people generally new to web development, it can be a bit
          of a black box approach with little learn effect.
          Then there are of course hundreds of more or less good tutorials available,
          written or as video. Here in my opinion the problem is often to know
          whether a tutorial is up-to-date with current version, whether it is good
          in general and so on.
          I often choose to go for a book as I prefer to use it later on as a
          source of reference.

          <h2>Some Tools and Packages</h2>
          <p>When jumping into React without a lot of prior exposure to JavaScript
            and Node.js, there will be quite a number of concepts to grasp and tools
            to learn. Many of them just work nicely in the background without any
            need for interaction. Here follows a short list of tools with a short
            description of what they do or are used for:
