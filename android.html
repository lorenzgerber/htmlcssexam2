      <h2>Fragment Arguments</h2>
      A number of operations or data flows are of interest:
      <ul>
        <li>Attach data when starting a new Fragment/Activity</li>
        <li>Retrieving extra/data from Activity (lazy way)</li>
        <li>Retrieving extra/data by attaching it to Fragment</li>
        <li>Obtain results back from a Fragment</li>
      </ul>


    <p>First of all, to start a Fragment/Activity from a given
    Fragment, for example OnClick, one uses the <code>new Intent()</code>.
    Nothing further is needed as the new Activity itself includes the code
    to start the Fragment. Code to provide the possibility of attaching an
    Extras/data resides in the Activity file: A static method to construct
    a new intent together with an <code>putExtra</code>. The static method
    is then called for actually starting the new Activity/Fragment. Here
    the Extra data is loaded.</p>

    <p>To retrieve the Extra/data, in it's simplest form, it can be obtained
    directly from the activity: <code> (typeCast) getActivity().getIntent().getSerializableExtra(ID)</p></code>.
    This is however from a modularity point of view not a very elegant solution.</p>


    <p>A nicer way is to attach the arguments to a Fragment. To do this, a
    static method <code>newInstance()</code> is added to the Fragment class
    to which the data shall be attached. This method takes as an argument
    the data that shall be included into the Fragment Bundle. Here the
    <code>createFragment</code> method in the calling Activity has to be
    adapted to use the new static method. Finally, the arguments are
    obtained in the Fragment by using the <code>getArguments().getSerializable(ID)</code>
    method.</p>
